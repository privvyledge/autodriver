My map: launches tf and loads maps (point cloud, vector map, lanelet)
My sensing: launches calibration files and sensors (use quanergy launch instead)
My localization: setup tf, loads vehicle model, filters point clouds by downsampling, and ndt_matching
My detection: launches euclidean cluster detection
My mission planning: launches vel pose connect, waypoints, lane stuff
My motion planning: launches vehicle socket/control (vehicle interface), obstacle avoidance, velocity set, pp or mpc, twist filter
